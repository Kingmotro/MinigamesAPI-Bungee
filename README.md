MinigamesAPI-Bungee
===================

This needs to be installed on the lobby server to allow setting signs in the lobby which will then be updated by the MinigamesAPI. Later it might support Arcade too.


Sign format for now:
- [0] "MGLib"
- [1] Minigame (e.g. MGSplegg)
- [2] Arena (e.g. test)
- [3] Server (e.g. minigames1)
